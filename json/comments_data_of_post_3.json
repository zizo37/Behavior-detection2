What tipped me off was when they started kicking out people for no reason, entering new participants everyday. Even worse, was that the codebase required us to grant the company\u2019s remote server access to our PC resources at all times.\n\nAnd then a friend of mine who was recently dropped started complaining about having his PC lag ever since. Only then did I feel the need to conduct an in-depth research on the company to see what exactly they were into. And just as I had predicted, they were into crypto mining using third-party GPUs from remote users all over the word.\n\nI mean who has better PC resources than creatives like programmers and graphics designers?",

Additionally, I recommend closely monitoring access to all your online platforms.\n\nHere\u2019s what the code does:\n\nSteals browser profiles, including cookies, saved passwords, browsing history, and other sensitive data.\n\nExtracts cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nRetrieves system passwords stored in keychains.\n\n\nFurthermore, in the final lines, the script attempts to locate a Python executable and download a file from a remote server. This could be (pending further investigation) part of a persistence mechanism allowing the attacker to maintain control of your machine.\n\nI strongly advise you to disconnect the system from the Internet immediately, consult a Cybersecurity specialist, and consider reformatting the computer to ensure it is secure.\n\nStay vigilant and safe!",
