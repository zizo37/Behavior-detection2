Even though I\u2019m a frontend engineer, I decided to take on the backend logic myself. It was an eye-opening experience, and I\u2019m still amazed at how much I learned from it. \n\nSo yes, the more projects you tackle and problems you solve, the better you grow.",

I'd love any input, but I'm going on 8 months of being out of school now and it doesn't help that the main input of advice is \"keep going and developing\" when I don't have the structure to continue my learning abilities in a real work environment.

Hence why it's a junior... they need time and guidance to develop these. This is also the reason why it is good to have juniors in your company and team. By guiding them you are forced to explain and rethink decisions made in the past, and find out the gaps in your own knowledge.",

This approach risks creating a significant gap between senior and junior developers, making it increasingly difficult for aspiring junior developers to start their careers in organizations. Everyone begins somewhere, and having mentors is crucial to professional growth. Not everything can or should be taught by AI\u2014real-world experience, learning from mistakes, and embracing imperfection are essential components of development. Junior developers deserve opportunities to grow, and organizations should focus on nurturing talent, not just downsizing for profit. Prioritizing short-term gains over long-term development neglects the responsibility of giving back to humanity. As challenges grow daily, we must support one another rather than discourage those genuinely striving to succeed.",

Just because there is an economic downturn, and right now the job market is not great, realistically it won't take long before we will have a shortage of engineers again.",

On top of that, people require experience to become a strategic thinker: this means you have been in several projects before, so your brain has enough context to plan and take decisions. Unfortunately for junior devs, even if they read a lot of theory, they can't achieve this position. In conclusion: projects need both junior devs and strategic thinkers...and many other qualified types of human beings.",
