In your place, I would give the name, plattform and ny other information I have about the recruiter, then I would report this user to the platform in which he's scamming people, and finally, I would report this to the police. They have a special department for cyber-crimes.\nNot doing so, is like letting them go on scamming people. You're safe, but what about the others? the catastrophic situation if their money were stolen. I do care about others, I would try to take them down. But, that's just me. Everyone is free to do what they think is better.",

No one expects you to create malware or defensive software, but you need to have, at least \"basic knowledge about large cybersec topics\". Ricardo Pulgar\u00edn G\u00f3mez made a statement that this was a \"very sophisticated method of social engineering\". He meant that the attackers used sophisticated social engineering methods to gain as much information about you and the system that they intended to exploit(reconnaissance step) and a clever way to \"make\" you to execute their malicious code on your machine(deployment/execution step). Ricardo meant what technique was, in the technical context. It was some variant of a CSRF attack, which variant, I don't know, I can't find repo of the malware given to you, to see the code.\n\nI have concluded that it was a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack based on your explanation and a few incomplete pictures that you have provided, and if I was some cybersecurity guy, I would need the original repo, to examine code, not screenshots, from anyone, to figure out the variant. Do the housekeeping of the browser, and you will be fine. Cheers!",
