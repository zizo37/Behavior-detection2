It is built on it.\n\nSame could be said for taking some things from the shop (money goes back into the business). Some do it in line with the law - we pay for the goods. Others take and do not pay - illegal (money is taken out of the business and causes fiscal strain).\n\nNot my country, so can\u2019t really project my own thoughts more beyond this simple take.\n\nI would however share my sentiment towards our own countries borders and the unmanageable number of illegal immigrants arriving on our shores.",
