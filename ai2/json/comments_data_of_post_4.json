Sharing from my own prespective when I first started my entapenuer journey 4 years ago I went to everyone for advice, a lot of the people I went too 'claimed' that if I just followed there method I'd be successful by the end of the week.\n\nSome people told me if I just showed up and was my authentic self then I would get clients by the end of the week. Some people told me that if I did Facebook LIVES then I'd get the clients I want and long for in no time.\n\nYet the truth is that no matter how hard I followed others, I failed. I learned that when I did things on my own, I learned from trial and error, when I reached out to others adding my own twist to the messages, that's when I started getting people interested in collaborating with me and loads of podcast and speaking engagements that helped me to support my-self. Justin Welsh",

They're the ones you teach yourself as you work.\nThe same one I would disagree with is that doing is better than meditation.  They're both necessary.  In fact, I would say from my experience as a writer and a spiritual teacher and coach that your writing is a form of meditation.  Both provide a pathway for your inner wisdom to get past your problem-solving mind.\nOne principle I've learned is that being should come before doing.  \\\"Being\\\" is when you're in receiver mode.  You receive inspiration and guidance about what to do.\nGet your guidance before you start doing.  It will make your doing easier and more effective.",
