Even though I’m a frontend engineer, I decided to take on the backend logic myself. It was an eye-opening experience, and I’m still amazed at how much I learned from it. So yes, the more projects you tackle and problems you solve, the better you grow.",

This approach risks creating a significant gap between senior and junior developers, making it increasingly difficult for aspiring junior developers to start their careers in organizations. Everyone begins somewhere, and having mentors is crucial to professional growth. Not everything can or should be taught by AI—real-world experience, learning from mistakes, and embracing imperfection are essential components of development. Junior developers deserve opportunities to grow, and organizations should focus on nurturing talent, not just downsizing for profit. Prioritizing short-term gains over long-term development neglects the responsibility of giving back to humanity. As challenges grow daily, we must support one another rather than discourage those genuinely striving to succeed.",

It is disheartening and false. We do need junior engineers! AI tools are not replacing them, because junior engineers also leveled up with the AI tools. Just because there is an economic downturn, and right now the job market is not great, realistically it won't take long before we will have a shortage of engineers again.",
